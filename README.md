# DB-intensive Course Project

## Project Description
XYZ is a dynamic startup e-commerce platform specializing in selling consumer electronics
products in Finland and Sweden. The platform aims to offer a vast array of electronics, from the
latest gadgets to essential household devices, ensuring consumers access to the newest and
most sought-after products. Due to high demand and rapid inventory turnover, real-time data
